The main goal of this document is to provide a refresher on regression methods and model selection using statistical learning. This guide also introduces several useful R functions that are common in Machine Learning.

A second goal of this document is to provide an R code companion of the ‘prostate cancer’ dataset that is introduced in The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL). The Dataset can be obtained here: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html.

The original dataset comes from a study by Stamey et al. (1989)
